# MelakaGo
# Introduction

  Melaka has long been a mesmerizing destination for tourists looking to immerse themselves in the rich tapestry of its legacy. It is a city rich in history and cultural significance. This UNESCO World Heritage Site has a harmonic fusion of historical sites, architectural wonders, a wide range of gastronomic delights, and a friendly, welcoming community. 
  
  In this case, we have come up with an application that can make touristsâ€™ visits more fun and memorable. We would love to develop an app called MelakaGo. MelakaGo is a tourist guide application that offers many benefits to the tourists that come to Melaka. The goal of this application is to offer a creative and all-encompassing solution to improve the experience of tourists visiting the alluring city of Melaka. Our goal is to produce a cutting-edge travel guide that is both an educational tool and lively, engaging travel companion for people of all interests and backgrounds.
  
  Furthermore, by using this application, the tourist will get an opportunity to gain many benefits because this application provides a voucher reward for tourists to redeem by answering the quiz question that is related to the tourist sport. To answer the question, the tourist should scan the provided QR Code at the tourist spot. All the QR Code can be seen at the board of the fact of the tourism spot.
  
  To ensure the application's progress was going smoothly, we decided to separate it into 3 applications. The first is MelakaGo Application that will be used by tourists, while MelakaGo Web Application will be used by Administration and lastly MelakaGo_Company that will be used by company registered.
